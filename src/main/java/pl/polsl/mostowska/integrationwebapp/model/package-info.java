/**
 * The model package encapsulates the core computational logic of the application, 
 * responsible for performing mathematical operations, such as numerical integration. 
 * It is designed to be independent of user interaction and solely focuses on the 
 * computation layer of the application.
 * 
 * This package serves as the foundation for the application's mathematical computations 
 * and is designed to work seamlessly with other application layers, such as the user 
 * interface or data input/output mechanisms.
